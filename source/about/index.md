## 超級boy | 5uperb0y
超級boy，還不成熟、能從書寫得到樂趣、喜歡科幻與任何讓人想仰望星空的作品的人。

超過 25 年的地球生存經驗，曾擔任代寫罰寫專員、生物競賽里代表、Iphone鏡頭產線作業員、紙飛機擲遠項目選手、慣於使用 = = 的小說家。

擅長睹物生情與有感而發，常迷上過氣或過先進的東西，例如熱血機器人動畫、即時戰略、星際探索和塞爆叛客。

目前從事生物資訊相關產業，關注的領域為微生物生態學和天文生物學，曾認真研究腸道與根際細菌群落的構建和演替，所以對常用的分析技術有一點經驗。

未來的期許是能有個繼續鑽研著什麼的明天，還有可以睡到自然醒的後天。

## 因為…… ，所以我寫作| Why I Write?
1. 因為我曾考慮當個流氓巨星，所以我寫作
2. 因為想把自己備份在二維空間，所以我寫作
3. 因為無奈時只能在稿紙上擦乾墨色的淚水，所以我寫作
4. 因為不想出聲也想唱歌，所以我寫作
5. 因為急著把思想自由兌現，所以我寫作
6. 因為寫作未必要像寫詩一樣有五十個理由，所以我寫作
7. 因為寫作，所以我寫作

## 以後還寫些什麼？| What's more?
寫些捨不得忘掉的事物、想轉頭說聲「你看！」的事物、能減緩因嘆息而加劇暖化的事物、「即使像冰塊融化了，還以水的形式存在」的事物。

## 興趣｜Interests

## 想記住的話

> Good bye, V. And, never stop fighting.

> Wake the fuck up, Samurai. We have a city to burn.

> **Three Rules of Cyberpunk**
> **Style over Substance**: It doesn’t matter how well you do something, as long as you look good doing it. If you’re going to blow it, make sure you look like planned it that way. Normally, clothes and looks don’t matter in a adventure – in this world, having a leather armor jacket and mirrorshades is a serious consideration.
> **Attitude is Everything**: It’s truth. Think dangerous; be dangerous. Think weak; be weak. Remember, everyone in the 2000’s is carrying lots of lethal hardware and high-tech enhancements. They won’t be impressed by you new H&K smartgun unless you swagger into the club looking like you know how to use it – and are just itching for an excuse.
> **Live on the Edge**: The Edge is that nebulous zone where risk takes and highriders go. On the Edge, you’ll risk your cash, your rep, even your life on something as vague as a principle or a big score. As a cyberpunk, you want to be the action, start the rebellion, light the fire. Join great causes and fight for big issues. Never drive slow when you can drive fast. Throw yourself up against danger and take it head on. Never play too safe. Stay committed to the Edge.

> Huh... This is why you don't bring back fallen warriors. Sooner or later, they're gonna see everything they fought for's turned to shit.


> Death to corpos!

> Same old shit, different packaging.
